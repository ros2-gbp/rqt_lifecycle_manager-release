Asynchronous ROS 2 backend for the rqt Lifecycle Manager plugin.

This module wraps an ``rclpy`` node to discover lifecycle nodes and to query
and change their states. Every service interaction uses ``call_async`` and
delivers its outcome through result callbacks, so the caller (the Qt GUI
thread) is never blocked waiting for a response.

class LifecycleManager:
    """
    Discover and control ROS 2 lifecycle nodes without blocking the caller.

    The manager reuses an externally-owned ``rclpy`` node (the one provided by
    ``rqt_gui_py`` and spun in a background executor thread). Service clients
    are created lazily and cached per lifecycle node. All requests are issued
    with ``call_async`` and their results are forwarded to the supplied
    callbacks from the executor thread.

    Threading model: the ``async_*`` methods are meant to be called from the
    GUI thread (typically from a ``QTimer``), while the ``_on_*_response``
    done-callbacks run on the executor thread that spins ``node``, and may
    overlap with each other under a ``ReentrantCallbackGroup``. The only
    state shared between those two threads is ``_pending``, which is guarded
    by ``_pending_lock`` to make the check-then-act membership test and the
    add/discard that follow it atomic.

    node : rclpy.node.Node
